This project is a working API that returns birth name, age and birthplace of the following rappers: 21 Savage, Chance the Rapper, J. Cole and Oddisee. It was developed by tching and coding along with the 100Devs Class 39 instruction. It is made almost exclusively in JavaScript, although there is a landing page with localhost instructions in HTML.

This does not include the Node module folder, so if it is cloned down, you will need to install Node and set up the project using the following in the terminal: 

mkdir api-project
cd api-project
npm init
npm install express --save

To open the api using the terminal, run node server.js and open the browser to localhost:8000.
